Before the company changed the name change to the current Blue Security that youâ€™ve become familiar with, the company was known as Enforce, which was founded in 1989.

The Company were initially only involved in guarding but started their expansion by opening an armed reaction division in 1995 . The company continued to make great strides in their industry  and they acquired Highbury Security, a firm specialising in alarms and armed response in the Hillcrest and Waterfall areas, in 1999. The new company was now known as the Enforce Security Group and they relocated to their present address in Pinetown.

As they broadened their horizons once more in 2000, the company bought Induna Security and their group of companies now included Enforce Electronics, Enforce Guarding, Justicia Investigations and Whistle Blowers and went on to achieve the ISO 9001:2000 international quality standard accreditation. Around 2000 they identified a need for more sophisticated electronic security solutions in the market and therefore formed a commercial security division. In 2003 the various component companies seperated and began to operate as independent companies.

Following the seperation they went from strength to strength as Enforce Electronic Security, they acquired the Armed Response division of Secureco in 2004 and further consolidated their presence in the market as a leading security firm. They then made the change from Enforce to the now well-known Blue Security in 2005, and theyâ€™ve maintained their reputation as Durbanâ€™s leading privately owned Armed Response company.

â€¢	Security and control for file shared with others via email
â€¢	Security for information extracted from enterprise and cloud applications
â€¢	Security for information extracted from VM or VPN sessions
â€¢	Security for information shared via web browser and FTP

Pawaa Software operates in the space of Information Security.  Our focus is to prevent data leaks at the hands of trusted users such as employees, partners, customers, vendors, suppliers and friends. We provide control over the information for the owner/creator of the information for its life time.

pawaaFILE packs multiple innovations:  one of the major innovation is that we removed the need for the key manager - with that we removed all complexities and vulnerabilities of key manager. 

pawaaFILE wraps around the native file and encrypts the content with 4 random keys.  Once the native file is converted to .paw file, only authorized users can access the information at authorized location for permitted duration as per the usage policy with complete audit trail.

pawaaFILE is unique and disruptive.  But to take full advantage of the technology, we built an implementation model called PLUSPawaa that abstracted the technology to such an extent that it can be attached to any application like a printer. 

We have already integrated Pawaa with some of key applications like Business Objects, Gmail, SugarCRM, Liferay among others.  We have also developed our own product based on our own technology called pawaaSHARE.  

The most exciting application is pawaaDOCS - which is the Google Apps integration.

About Us: History
map-3The New Forests Company was founded in 2004 with the vision of creating a sustainable timber resource in East Africa amidst rampant deforestation. As one of the most fertile regions in the world, East Africa should be able to supply its own timber needs and even export rather than importing the majority. We are excited to be reversing the traditional tale of exporting raw materials and importing value added products in a way that creates regional social, economic and environmental benefits.

We planted our first tree in Mubende, Uganda in 2004. Since then the Company has rapidly expanded with four greenfield plantations in Uganda (Namwasa, Kirinya and Luwunga) and Tanzania (Kilolo) as well as a 49- year concession to manage an established plantation in Rwanda (the buffer zone around Nyungwe National Park).

The Company is passionate about growing African forestry and continues to plant trees to counteract massive and rapid deforestation (The World Bank estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa will deforest 1.3 million hectares per annum). The Company also complies with the best forestry, social and environmental practices, as audited annually to comply with the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC™) certification.

The Group has also begun commercialising its timber assets and now operates four pole treatment plants, producing both CCA and creosote treated transmission, telephone, fencing and building poles, three sawmills (construction lumber, wooden pallets, school desks etc.) and a number of charcoal kilns (providing efficient biomass energy as an alternative to the expensive Heavy Fuel Oil).

Plus, LifeShield was one of the first to provide remote access to your home security system. With LifeShield, you have always been able to log into your system from anywhere in the world for free. Some of the other systems are finally able to offer you this same type of access, but you'll pay for it. They'll add an extra cost to your monthly monitoring payments.

sports,Compact Particle Acceleration,"CPAC is developing and commercializing a highly compact intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) system powered by the dielectric-wall accelerator (DWA), a revolutionary proton accelerator that will have a substantially smaller structure and greater flexibility than other accelerators.*

Proton therapy is acknowledged in the radiotherapy community as a superior mode of treatment over standard photon therapy.  Proton therapy significantly reduces the amount of damage to adjacent healthy tissue that often occurs with traditional photon radiation methods.  In addition to being a better form of therapy, in most places it has greater reimbursement and can be performed more efficiently.  Therefore, there can be a greater volume of patients treated for each treatment room.  Yet, of the several million patients treated worldwide with radiotherapy each year, only a few thousand receive particle therapy.  Why so few?  The primary reasons are system cost and equipment size.  Most current particle-based systems exceed $100M and can approach $200M, which is driven by both expensive components, facilities and the need for multiple treatment rooms in order to achieve sufficient treatment volume to support the system costs.

CPAC’s initial product will be an FDA approved fixed-beam proton therapy unit that will focus on stereotactic cancer treatments that are typically within the breast, chest, central nervous system, head, neck, and eyes.  The treatment volume for these cancers represents 54% of all existing radiation treatments.  With additional development, later systems will likely generate higher energy levels and include the capability to move the beamline for greater directionality.  We anticipate that the later systems will be able to treat most forms of cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,

The patented, adaptive, and self-learning algorithms of Giant Gray technology “see” anomalies often hidden in oceans of data, bringing to light actionable insights with an intelligence that is anything but artificial. In short, Giant Gray helps dramatically improve business operational awareness and incident response for its customers – as well as prevent costly interruptions and breakdowns – through its Graydient technology platform with applications in industrial (SCADA/ICS), physical security and surveillance, and cybersecurity environments.

Most data analytics technology is challenging to deploy, expensive to use and maintain, confusing to understand, and limited to identifying known problems in a particular domain. Giant Gray’s patented technology reduces costs and simplifies usage and maintenance by teaching itself from observing data – and it excels at detecting the unexpected and providing improved context by correlating various, disconnected data sources. These real-time insights allow customers to make operational adjustments before early-warning signals grow into true incidents that impact safety, security, and business operations.

Our games and challenges motivate ‘Racers' to achieve their personal best (PB) by allowing them to live-race a three dimensional avatar of themselves (previous run/cycle), their friends, celebrities, or even flesh eating zombies pursuing at their target pace.

On foot, bike (in future skis or snow board), whether you're outdoors or in the gym, a serious aspiring athlete training for a big event,  or a casual fitness enthusiast; Race Yourself provides you real-time on-screen technique feedback and encouragement during your exercise and sporting endeavors. 

Our vision is to bring the adrenaline-addictiveness of gaming to exercise, to do what Wii Sports did for the Wii but for Glass. With an in-app purchase model harnessing game economy mechanics similar to Clash of Clans, we are creating something healthy that people will want to be hooked on.

SwingShot’s Cyclops™ on-course cameras are high-end HD video cameras mounted atop a 3-foot high shaft with a stainless steel turf spike making it easy to position and record anywhere on the golf course. 

Serious golfers know the best way to improve your game is to analyze video of your swing. Most swing analysis videos are recorded on the driving range out of convenience. Yet, golfers know they swing better on the range, where they hit 20 balls in a row with the same club from a perfect lie than they do on the course, where they switch clubs on each shot and hit from the fairway, rough, bunkers, and various lies. 

SwingShot is part of the ~$1 billion action video camera market. The largest player is Woodman Labs, which sold nearly $600 million worth of its GoPro cameras and accessories in 2012.  

Every year there are nearly 500 million rounds of golf played by over 27 million golfers each year in the U.S. alone. These figures are nearly doubled when the international market is factored in.

Its mission is to create a truly linked world where every object smartly helps improve your life, no matter where you are or what’s important to you.

There are more than 1.9 billion Smartphone users in the world and the average person wastes up to 50 minutes per day looking for their personal items; that’s 14 days per year, and three years every lifetime!

Linquet began its journey by solving this frustrating problem for Smartphone users and introduced the first cloud-based ANTI-LOSS solution (aka PREVENTIVE) for phones and valuables (e.g. keys, wallet, bikes, pets). Users attached tiny Linquet devices to their belongings and - using Bluetooth - “linqed” those items to their phone, both of which would sound an alarm when any of them fell out of range. And with its real-time cloud connection, Linquet ensured no one would leave anything behind.

But we were just getting started.

Now we’re spreading the magic of the IoT to other aspects of our lives. New generation of Linquet - in addition to smartly protecting your valuables - will make sharing stuff smart, like safely renting out your bike, or sharing your keys with your out of town guests (think IoT powers Sharing Economy).

Their platform allows internal teams to achieve 100% automation of dispute management by aggregating data from multiple disparate vendors and running it through rules-based workflows and machine learning.

3 Key Benefits
 - Lower Overall Dispute Rate
 - Improved Dispute Win Rate
 - Less Time Wasted Managing Disputes 

Our Approach
The Chargeback App aggregates your processor, gateway, and sales data (customer, product, shipping, and usage) as well as issuer alerts into a single portal. This allows Chargeback to combat the fraudulent use of chargeback rights in real-time and allows your team to quickly take meaningful action such as issuing refunds, blocking orders, preventing fulfillment, rerouting shipments, and generating dispute responses with minimal effort.

Lowering Your Dispute Ratio with Real-time Resolution 
Through the Chargeback App, merchants benefit from Real-time Resolution. This feature provides customer, product, shipping and usage detail to the dispute analyst at the cardholder’s issuing bank at the start of the dispute lifecycle. With this enhanced level of detail, the issuer is equipped to decide if the cardholder should file a dispute. This level of customer, order and product detail is normally not available until well into the dispute process. With Chargeback’s Real-time Resolution feature, it becomes the first line of defense and stops the dispute from ever becoming a chargeback. 

Improving Your Dispute Win Rate with Best Practices and Expertise 
The Chargeback App is used to manage all types of disputes and facilitates quick and comprehensive response generation for all categories of disputes including, Fraud, Authorization, Processing Errors, and Cardholder Disputes. Much of the response data will auto-populate from connected data sources into contextual evidence blocks written to address and adhere to the network’s rules and regulations. The Chargeback App guides users through the addition of required and/or supplemental compelling evidence based on the network reason code, transaction type and any applicable transaction modifiers to ensure the best possible responses are provided to the issuer and ensuring the highest possible win-rates.

Reducing Time Spent Managing Disputes 
Identifying and gathering the data required to respond to a single dispute traditionally requires logging into several separate systems, including OMS, CRM, ERP, fraud filters, shipping vendors and multiple PSPs (gateways, processors, networks). By consolidating the data from each, the Chargeback App eliminates the excessive time traditionally spent dealing with a dispute. By programming the dispute rules set forth by each network (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) your team no longer needs to research and understand the nuances of reason codes, transaction modifiers and exceptions necessary to properly respond to disputes. The Chargeback App provides expert guidance and support at every stage of the dispute lifecycle to ensure the recovery of lost revenue.",,,,,,,,,,,

privacy and security,CloudMask,"CloudMask is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Using patent-pending methods, CloudMask, running on user devices, transparently intercepts and analyses data to identify, tokenize, and encrypt sensitive information. The intercepted data may belong to a variety of applications, such as Google, SalesForce, Box, and MS Office 365 and practically any other application you could be using. 

CloudMask converts your sensitive data to tokens that have the same structure as the original data but are meaningless, jumbled texts bearing no relation to the original data. As a result, the application receives meaningless tokens, instead of the original private data.  These tokens do not break the application’s functionality, nor can it be broken by any cryptanalysis. Accordingly, the application continues to function as before and security is transparent, without requiring any changes to existing applications.

CloudMask protects you against unauthorized disclosure and vendor misuse of the data as well. 

These techniques also apply to on-premise applications, and accordingly CloudMask mitigates insider threats by utilizing user-owned keys (asymmetric key pair). These keys are never shared or transmitted over the network. Only users/systems explicitly authorized by the data owner may use their personal keys to restore tokens back to their meaningful data.

One of the biggest competitive advantage of CloudMask is its scalability. This is needed not only to address the top of the pyramid, such as governments and large enterprise. But it is also very important when offering a cloud service to potentially millions of users, and even more devices.

CloudMask is a Common Criteria certified. Common Criteria is a global security certification that approved by 26 governments, demonstrating that the user data remains private even if the network, application and CloudMask servers are fully compromised.

Now to complete the picture, our long term vision is to expand the model to cover Internet of Things devices. In other words there is no reason to limit our space to end-user, we want to protect private information no matter where their being created.",,,,,,,,,,,

The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities – if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning.

The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the game’s remaining timeline.

The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country.

PlayViz breaks down each team’s performance into its three basic aspects – batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time.

Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables.

Each team’s fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding.

BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score.

The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time.",,,,,,,,,,,

But not just the regular, military-style obstacles you’ll see on every other event out there, that do nothing but freeze, burn, lacerate and electrocute you.

Instead, their obstacles are inspired by all those game shows they love – Takeshi’s Castle, Wipeout, Gladiator, Ninja Warrior and more.

So if you’ve ever thought that the Travelator looked like a challenge, a sweeper obstacle would be a great laugh, or you just fancy a go on their big balls, then Rough Runner is for you.",,,,,,,,,,,

privacy and security,AttachingIT,"Businesses are moving to the cloud. The cloud offers services that will make their IT infrastructure cheaper and more scalable with less maintenance.  Although the cloud is very interesting for businesses, there are major security and privacy concerns. Due to fear or strict regulations, businesses struggle with secrecy, control and ownership of data in the cloud. For these reasons most businesses choose to go for private clouds and even legacy on premise solutions, making unnecessary costs and effort.  

Secrecy of data mainly depends on encryption and key management. Cloud providers provide encryption services but hold the keys to this encryption and are therefore a shared reader of the content. If data is encrypted before it is stored, most cloud providers nowadays have enough computation power to break ciphers that are considered safe.

Up until now there is no technology that will leverage the power of cloud scalability whilst maintaining full secrecy of data that is stored. One solution next to encryption that would increase secrecy is to chunk data and distribute it over multiple cloud containers or providers. Although you hold the keys, the increase of secrecy with this approach might still lead to partially readable data if the cipher is broken.",,,,,,,,,,,

With an injection of capital and the resources required for marketing and R&D, Storelli is positioned to become the newest and next big brand in soccer.

Soccer is the most played sport in the world- every year more than 80mm active players are at risk from suffering preventable injuries in US and Western Europe alone. The great majority of these players are youth, with  parents sitting on the sidelines anxiously hoping their child doesn't get hurt. At the same time, coaches and the players themselves hate injuries and would love to avoid them, and even retailers are hungry for new categories of products to increase the spend per customer. In sum, EVERY stakeholder in the market is highly motivated to stop soccer injuries and thus want to see Storelli succeed.

Despite the market demand for a solution to injuries, no brand focuses on this need: the major diversified sports brands (e.g., Adidas, Nike) do not focus on protection in soccer. The niche sports medicine players (e.g., McDavid, Shock Doctor) do not focus on soccer.

Current security controls are being undermined. Compromised SSL/TLS, SSH and mobile certificates and keys undermine data loss prevention, next-gen firewalls, strong authentication, sandboxing and other security systems. Attackers 1) mask their true identity using keys and certificates and 2) hide their actions by encrypting data which means you can’t look inside for threats.

privacy and security,Authomate,"Authomate's platform makes strong security easy to use by shifting the burden of authentication from a human’s memory to their smartphone, creating a unique identity which becomes how you access your digital world. Good passwords are hard to remember so users take short cuts to work around. With Authomate, credentials are stored on the smartphone – eliminating the human element from the authentication flow. 

Authomate simplifies the user experience by allowing the user’s smartphone in proximity to an application, website, system, or device to seamlessly authenticate the user, while eliminating the need to enter user names, passwords and one-time codes or answering challenge questions – enabling companies to implement stronger, always on security and enforce policies, in each case, without complicating or frustrating their end users and customers. Key features include: enablement of multifactor authentication using contextually aware, dynamic factors; the ability to share access without sharing credentials; the ability to interface with VPNs and other non-web based applications that require credential input (including login for Macs and PCs); geofencing and geotagging; date and time restrictions; biometrics; defense against phishing sites; mitigating attack surfaces used to steal credentials; and robust logging of access. 

Authomate allows enterprises to implement strong security policies that can be easily adopted by their users and customers, while eliminating the vulnerabilities of weak and reused passwords, forgotten passwords that lead to costly recovery processes, and password spreadsheets that may be shared between team members, and eliminates attack surfaces used to harvest credentials (e.g., malware, keyloggers, Man-in-the-Middle, Man-in-the-Browser, phishing and social engineering). Authomate’s solution is designed to fit within the enterprise’s existing security framework so it can be implemented in weeks, not months or years as required by other authentication solutions.

While Authomate’s initial focus is on user authentication, the solution extends beyond access to applications and can be used for any transaction requiring credentials to be given to establish trust and access. The solution architecture reverses the credential flow, thereby eliminating the ability to compromise static devices like point of sale terminals, kiosks, ATMs, or websites for card not present, disabling the ability to use these avenues as an attack vector to steal credentials.

They kick-started their operations in Bangalore with a simple yet effective solution – Internet Protocol (IP) cameras with built-in intelligence to detect events automatically. As the business started to take its own shape, Silvan expanded its scope by entering into the sphere of home automation based on contemporary technologies such as cloud services and the Internet of Things.

Ubiquitous access to the home automation system from the smart phone was first on the list of priorities for Silvan’s founders. They were keen on creating a generation of new-age automation where smart phones could be used to control all the appliances and devices in a house. The focus was also on being a ‘complete solutions company’ rather than being just a ‘product company’. Silvan’s objective is simple – to cater to an evolving Indian lifestyle, which demands a fresh approach, wherein a modern and traditional way of life can co-exist.

Silvan’s solutions for home automation has been welcomed by several big players in the field of housing – Sobha, Brigade, Nambiar Builders, Total Environment, Tata Housing, and Lodha to name a few.

How did Terminal.com start?

When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google.

After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud.

Our first field of activity is anti-piracy, where we changed the usual takedown-only approach. Now we are deploying more of our innovative potential by expanding into anti-counterfeiting and anti-defamation markets.

Thanks to a proprietary crawler and a database of unauthorized websites, Kopjra looks for the infringements on the web and on peer-to-peer networks. Results can be analyzed with in-house automatic content recognition technologies and they are monitored over time.

Kopjra protects clients’ rights with automated takedown notices, which are sent to involved subjects. We collect data on this activity to provide analytics on takedown effectiveness. We know our clients need to gain back the loss caused by online piracy: patent pending automated forensic digital evidence acquisition and procedures to estimate economic loss increase the possibility to obtain court-ordered refunding.

We provide social and geographical big data analytics for market surveys by tracking millions of unauthorized releases of digital works distributed on peer-to-peer networks. Kopjra is not only effective on enforcement: we plan and execute unconventional peer-to-peer marketing strategies to monetize the unauthorized diffusion.
 
The business model we are working with is a monthly premium subscription, through which the user may monitor one or more digital works. Our customers vary with respect to their dimensions: the independent emerging artist willing to monitor her work diffusion to the big media enterprise to whom we offer tailored services involving our automated features.

The aim of AposTherapy is to address the biomechanical abnormalities that are characteristic of various orthopaedic conditions – the body's mal-alignment, muscle weakness, impaired neuromuscular control and the resulted abnormal pathological movement patterns. The ultimate goal of the treatment is to promote and restore desired motor patterns.

Our philosophy is to empower patients by enhancing their understanding of their condition and the underlying causes of their symptoms. This knowledge, combined with a personalized treatment modality, allows the patient to take active control over their therapy and progress. Their progress is closely monitored and clinical outcomes are shared with the patients so they have an objective measurement of their improvement.

sports,Nymbl Science,"About Nymbl Science:

Nymbl Science is a Colorado based company with the mission of using medical science and mobile technology to improve balance and prevent 1 million falls.  The Nymbl System leverages validated studies, plus our Chief Scientist Dr. JP Farcy’s 35 years of clinical experience to provide a mobile-based balance improvement solution. 

Nymbl consists of (1) a comprehensive balance evaluation and (2) a balance improvement program designed to be delivered on the smartphone or in a class. 

The Balance Evaluation is a 3-part test administered on a smartphone or tablet that guides the user through the required exercises in approximately 5 minutes.  These tests measure stability, strength, and movement, and conform to the CDC STEADI protocol for balance measurement.  The user is provided with a numerical balance score (1-100), an age group percentile, and the score is divided into its component parts. If a user is at risk for falls in any of the three categories, this is displayed. 

The Balance Training app is a self-guided or coach-led intervention that prescribes appropriate exercises based on the balance score and provides simultaneous cognitive challenges. This “dual tasking” approach stimulates brain plasticity and mimics real world settings where a user may fall because they become distracted. The exercises parallel the Otago recommendation, which demonstrated a 35% reduction in falls, plus exercises recommended by the Harvard Medical School.  

The app animates and times the exercises for the user either in home or in a class setting. The cognitive challenges, which are made up of trivia, math, pattern matching, memory problems etc. engage the user, and the participants are often seen laughing while they perform their tandem stands, lunges and wall sits.  While the primary purpose of the cognitive challenges is to improve brain plasticity, they also make the training fun and increase user engagement.

We have implemented our program in senior living communities with compelling results – community members who have gone through the program have increased their balance scores over 30% on average in 30 days, and  in one community 50% of the residents who were at fall risk (based on the CDC measure) were no longer at risk!

Nymbl won the 2017 Prime Health Competition, as the most promising health tech startup in Colorado.  We received offers from Kaiser Permanente, University of Colorado Health, Centura and SCL Health for pilot programs, all of which are proceeding.  We have signed an Innovation Partnership with UCHealth.  These key healthcare organizations  are looking to reduce falls both in-patient and out-patient, and also use our measure of balance as a vital sign"" to improve population outcomes.""",,,,,,,,,,,

Everspin's unparalleled innovation has come from a simple, but unprecedented idea: If hacking occurs when enough time is given to hackers, why not cut down such time? 


After years of R&D, Everspin has found a way to solve the fundamental problem that all of the existing mobile cybersecurity solutions entail: security modules are placed in the user’s app and they do not change until the app is updated, which inevitably renders mobile apps vulnerable to hacking.

Everspin’s technology enables its security module to be sent by Everspin server to the app and constantly replaced by a new module, which settles the issues that come from the location and invariability of the current solutions. 

Though its products are currently targeting the mobile app market, Everspin with its highly versatile technology is expected to launch its service for Web/PC, server and IoT in the near future. 


■ Solution Features:
-App/OS/Memory forgery prevention.
-Real-time hacking detection.
-Instant security update to multiple types of devices without any user-side program update.

■ Credibility
-First ever to pass all the security tests by National Security Research Institute in Korea(100% blocking rate for 3,000++ hacking attempts).
-Within 1year sales, secured 23cutomers including 3/5 of major banks in Korea.
-SBI Holdings to gradually implement Everspin solution to all of its 200++ subsidiaries around the world.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,"Raccoon.World Technologies, Inc","Raccoon.Recovery is a physical rehabilitation tool to treat patients after accidents and neurological diseases. We have built a hardware device you can attach to your arms, legs, back or your hands. And there is an application that tracks the treatment. 
But our secret sauce is — we’re finally making it fun. Patients can connect recovery devices to any video game there is, and play video game using their body only with the movements that are prescribed to them.
Raccoon.Recovery will be full-body, but we start with hand rehabilitation because we have experience in creating game controllers.
 
The solution consists of following components: hardware (controller to use in any game and sensors to gather data about motions and psycho emotional state), cloud storage to save data, software (PC app) for processing data, ML-based treatment creation and correction and creating reports.
 
Business model:
B2B, subscription fee. We start from German market. As customer segments we consider public and private rehabilitation centers (both outpatient and inpatient) and self-employed rehab specialists.
Rehab centers prescribe our device and application to the patient as a part of their rehab course. We receive subscription fee from the centers per patient. After we will be listed in catalogs of insurance companies, they will reimburse our solution to rehab centres.

It uses machine learning to detect anomalies and classify attack data. By analysing web server traffic in real-time, the software detects and immediately determines the sophistication, capability and effectiveness of each attack. This information is translated into a risk score to prioritise incident response.

Cyberlytic’s patented classification approach is far more effective at assessing attacks than traditional signature-based security solutions and adapts to new or evolving threats without requiring manual intervention.

•	Advanced threat detection: Unsupervised machine learning detects anomalies in web traffic, whilst supervised machine learning classifies attacks based on threat characteristics.
•	Threat analysis, visibility and prioritisation: The Profiler only alerts when a pre-defined risk threshold is exceeded and provides details of malicious web activity.
•	Simple deployment and zero maintenance: No rules or signatures means no additional demand on analysts to detect even the most sophisticated attacks.

The Profiler is easily deployed by installing a web server agent or by connecting to mirrored network traffic.  Data is sent to the Profiler, which is hosted in Cyberlytic’s secure cloud.

The solution is powered by DvC™ (data vs. code), a patented, real-time, signature-less engine. DvC assumes that there is no legitimate reason for executable code to be present in any data file. As such, it does not rely on heuristics or behaviors (which are core limitations of competing technologies), and definitively identifies and terminates any instance of malicious code such as hidden CPU instructions,  encrypted and polymorphic payloads, shellcodes and other commands typically buried in data file. DvC also accurately identifies an blocks malicious active content using advanced flow analysis, de-obfuscation techniques and deep content evaluation, to reveal threat intent within any inbound data file covering machine, operating system and application levels, thereby rendering such sandbox evading attacks harmless to the enterprise.

Solebit was founded in 2014 by a team of world-class cybersecurity experts, all graduates of the elite technology units in the Israel Defense Forces with years of experience in offensive and defensive security.

health care,Orgenesis,"Orgenesis is a development stage company with a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of diabetes by correcting malfunctioning organs with new functional tissues created from the patient’s own existing organs. Orgenesis employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation.

Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection.

Orgenesis has manifested promising results in in-vitro and in-vivo studies using human liver tissues. Based on this significant discovery and these findings, Orgenesis has designed an efficient and clear work-plan to initiate clinical testing in the next few months allowing the company to launch phase I clinical trials following FDA guidelines followed by the launch of Phase II clinical trials within a year.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,Magnomics,"Overview:
Magnomics is a diagnostics, medical technology company committed to delivering a new generation of rapid, portable molecular diagnostic tests with applications in the human health, veterinary, and food industry markets. Affordable, disposable diagnostic cartridges will be produced in large scale and shipped via global distributors. The team behind the company has world class experience in biotechnology, electronics and physics, with a proven track record in managing start-ups. Magnomics has a Letter of Intent from a leading dairy company and won the 2015 Kansas City Animal Health Investment Forum innovation award, as well as the Ag Biotech Entrepreneurial Showcase award in North Carolina in 2016. €1.6M in seed financing have been raised through grants and investments. Magnomics is seeking €1.5M to conclude the prototyping of its first product in the animal health space. 

Technology:
Magnomics technology stands on four patent families, with more in the pipeline, and has been published over twenty times in prestigious scientific journals. Magnomics provides a portable and affordable PCR device that requires no training to operate. The product integrates sample preparation, amplification and DNA detection within a single cartridge using microfluidics, making use of a novel magnetoresistive DNA sensing technology. 

Market:
The veterinary diagnostics market is hungry for innovation and has low regulatory barriers. This market is estimated at €4 billion, with an 8.6% expected growth for the period 2016 to 2021. Magnomics will focus on the detection of bovine mastitis - an inflammation of the dairy cow’s mammary gland, whose treatment depends on the bacteria involved. This ailment causes over €30 billion in annual losses for producers worldwide. In the initial target markets (North America, Europe and Brazil), there are 56 million dairy cows with an average mastitis base incidence 30%. Given a €25 price tag and some segmentation, this amounts to a serviceable market of close to €300M, in which a penetration of 10-15% is expectable. The product can be sold either directly to farmers or to veterinarians: strategic partnerships are being negotiated with large pharma/dairy players to ensure market access.

Competition:
Companies such as AAD, DeLaval, and PortaCheck already have on-site solutions, which include California Mastitis Tests (CMT), Somatic Cell Counters and variants (SCC), as well as lateral flow strips. These current on-site diagnostics tools indicate the presence of an infection but are unable to determine the pathogen, which is key to define an appropriate treatment. Culture testing (e.g. Idexx, Virbac) is the current benchmark and is being tried on site as well: although cheap, the added value is greatly diminished due to long waiting times and difficulties in setting up a working protocol. Finally, laboratories provide fast molecular solutions (e.g. ThermoFisher) that are fast but expensive, while requiring complicated logistics due to sample collection that increase lead times. Magnomics will bring these molecular solutions to the farm in a convenient and affordable product.

So in the cities where there is a contactless card for public transport, like Oyster card in London, people can use the same card in stores as their loyalty card. Walmoo will work for multiple businesses. The idea is to have all small business in an area use Walmoo for their customer loyalty. That way, it is only one QR code or card for the customer to use, and it builds support among small business in the area.
 
Walmoo solution's flat Pay-as-you-Use pricing model is a perfect way to keep it affordable regardless of the business size as it adjusts the needs. The forever free (each month's first 50 visitors) plan without functional limitations is a great deal for very small businesses and for testing the solution without trial time limitations. 

Walmoo company is established in 2014 in Latvia which is one of the Baltic states located in Northern Europe. The project has 2200+ registered business customers from more than 50 different countries. Walmoo Loyalty-as-a-Service solutions is built using Walmoo's identification & engagement platform with loyalty engine which has been used in solutions around loyalty programs, ski resort ticketing solutions and solutions for events.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,Lyndra Therapeutics,"At Lyndra, we aim to fundamentally change the way people take medicine. Through the development of oral, ultra long-acting, sustained release therapies, we hope to drastically improve adherence and efficacy. Recent studies have shown that adherence significantly improves with less frequent dosing, such as weekly or monthly administration(2). Better adherence leads to better health outcomes. For instance, it is estimated that improved adherence to antihypertensive treatment alone could prevent 89,000 premature deaths in the United States annually(3). Our technology was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Langer in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Lyndra formulations transform the daily pill into a weekly or monthly dose, promising to improve patient adherence as well as to optimize the pharmacokinetic profile of the dosage form. With weekly or even monthly dosing, the technology promises to redefine what long-acting oral formulation means. Lyndra's innovative oral formulations work via gastric residence. Once inside the stomach, the dosage form, which is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule, adopts a star-shaped configuration. Due to its size and geometry the system remains in the gastric cavity until pre-determined break points permit the formulation to split into small pieces and safely pass through the GI tract similarly to indigestible food. While in the gastric cavity the formulation releases drug at a site of high absorption in the human body. The rate of drug release, as well as the time point of dissolution, are highly adjustable features. 

Providing a single, ultra long-acting pill eliminates the need to take pills daily thereby simplifying patients’ lives and ensuring their disease is consistently and continuously treated. ",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,TrackActive,"We provide insurers, their health providers and customers a health platform to optimise rehabilitation from injury, assist in the prevention of injury and chronic disease comorbidities such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and mental health disorders, and facilitate the ongoing self management of health.

Problem:
Delayed intervention, suboptimal healthcare, lack of trusted information, and adverse lifestyle factors are key reasons why patients have ongoing musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. neck and low back pain) and develop chronic diseases. 83% of health insurer outgoings are spent on claims, making them reliant on customers achieving timely recovery from ill health and maintenance of good health in order to remain financially viable. The insurer currently has limited ability to influence this as they are disconnected from their customers.

Solution:
TrackActive will provide an exercise rehabilitation, early intervention, and prevention application, incorporating wearable technology and behavioural science, to address the needs of customers with, or at risk of, musculoskeletal conditions and chronic diseases. This will decrease reliance on health providers and reduce claims costs. It will compliment the existing TrackActive rehabilitation platform to be a complete self management solution for the customer. TrackActive may also improve satisfaction and retention of customers with their insurer.

Traction:
The TrackActive rehabilitation platform was developed and launched in March 2015. An Australian Government grant, 26 000 patients across 11 countries, 70 data parameters, a content licencing partnership with Johnson & Johnson, and early relationships with insurers highlights the ability of TrackActive to deliver effective digital healthcare solutions.

Competitive Advantage:
TrackActive has acquired unique knowledge through extensive exercise research reviews and intelligence from two years of data collection to expand its offering to ‘self service’ early intervention and prevention solutions for insurance customers. Additionally, as rehabilitation can act as a trigger to lifestyle change and ongoing wellness in patients, TrackActive is well positioned to own this customer experience due to the traction achieved with its existing rehabilitation platform.

Revenue Model:
TrackActive will charge a fee to insurers based on the number of active customers using the application and access levels to data insights. TrackActive also currently receives subscription revenue from health clinics using the rehabilitation platform, as well as content licencing fees with third party, non-competing organisations.",,,,,,,,,,,

This medication could potentially prevent the development of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), or epilepsy. All these conditions are due to multitude of blows to the head as suffered by, for example, boxers such as Mohammad Ali.
Medicortex Finland Oy was founded in June 2014 as a BioTurku member; its laboratories are located in the Turku Science Park Bioincubator.

Medicortex’s aim is to develop a simple, easy-to-use and relatively cheap test based on a biomarker found in one of the body fluids. Ideally, the test could be applied within minutes of the initial insult.
A biomarker diagnostic test for TBI may be of use in identifying individuals with severe TBI, who are at risk of secondary brain injury and therefore require increased surveillance, or for those individuals with mild TBI, who otherwise may remain undiagnosed and untreated.

privacy and security,Olympus Sky Technologies,"Olympus Sky Technologies presents Zeus, an IoT Security Suite featuring a powerful capability to protect, organize, configure, and manage secure communication of network assets in Security Clusters according to physical and virtual attributes.  Zeus networks offer vastly improved security through high cryptographic entropy and frequent refreshing of security credentials.
At the heart of Zeus is a decentralized cryptographic authentication protocol known as Autonomous Key Management (AKM).  AKM is designed to eliminate the complexity and scalability costs of network architectures based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  AKM eliminates Public/Private Key exchanges and immediately enables encrypted network communications with negligible latency.  
AKM is a certificate-free protocol that secures a Zeus network using just a single set of security credentials, that are uniquely generated every session with perfect forward secrecy.  AKM security credentials are never exchanged in communication between nodes within a Zeus security mesh, making it exceedingly difficult for an attacker to intercept any useful information that could enable a network breach.  If a breach does occur, a Zeus network can dynamically and automatically re-establish new security credentials across the security mesh to defeat the intrusion and allow operation to continue without interruption.
The light digital footprint and low processing requirements of Zeus make it ideal for any sized network device. Zeus operates with equal ease across use cases consisting of both static and dynamic networks, with robust sync and re-sync capabilities.
The Zeus product family consists of both hardware and software products, including administrative, cloud and chain-of-trust provisioning tool-sets .  Zeus is the future of low-cost IoT network security – Simple, Scalable, and Secure.",,,,,,,,,,,

agriculture and farming,Benson Hill Biosystems,"Boosting crop yields on existing acreage and with limited inputs is the foremost challenge in sustainable production agriculture.
With the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, agricultural output must increase by 70% in this timeframe. As nations such as the United States pursue agriculture-intensive energy policies, demand and price volatility for agriculture commodities will continue to intensify. Diminishing agricultural resources such as arable land and fresh water will further compound this challenge.In the last twenty years, crop yields have improved from intensive breeding programs, increased planting densities, and biotech traits such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. However, blockbuster trait releases in recent years are only having single digit percentage impacts on yield. At a time when step changes are needed in crop productivity, yields are plateauing.

One contributing factor to the decline in crop development is that nearly all commercial biotech traits are single-gene approaches to protecting yield. But to realize step changes and avoid a yield plateau, we must innovate beyond single-gene approaches to protecting yield, and realize step wise gains by increasing intrinsic yield.

Benson Hill is dedicated to delivering substantial production gains to the agriculture sector by advancing biotech-based traits to increase intrinsic yield.",,,,,,,,,,,

Doctors today spend hours during Endoscopic Procedures looking at the LCD screens in order to explore, examine and treat various conditions. At Magentiq Eye we put the growing power of Deep Learning, Image and Video Processing to the help of doctors, so they can be more accurate and effective- ultimately saving millions of lives and billions of dollars. Our first product is APDS: Automatic Polyp Detection System, developed to be used in online and offline colonoscopies. 

Our APDS (Automatic Polyp Detection System) can point out the suspicious locations of polyps in the videos, increasing the attentiveness of doctors during procedures, thus helping them to reduce their polyp miss-rates. Given the large population that annually undergoes colonoscopy, even a modest decrease in polyp miss-rate can save a lot of lives! The APDS- RT runs on the video feed from the endoscopic camera used by the physician in real time during the endoscopic procedure (currently only on Colonoscopy Procedure). The APDS-OFL is a software that runs in off-line mode on pre-Recorded Colonoscopy Videos.  

It is estimated that 40 million colonoscopy procedures are performed every year (almost 40% in the US alone). The ability of colonoscopy procedures to decrease the number of colon cancer cases has been proven without a doubt and their number expected to grow. However, researches have shown that there is about 25% of misses (undetected polyps) in those procedures, misses which can, unfortunately, cause interval cancer. Within this context The APDS can be sold as an add-on to the colonoscopy system or as a service (license per exam), paid by the clinic or hospital.  Once the APDS system would be formally proven, during the next year, to improve polyp detection rate, it could be sold either jointly with the endoscopic equipment providers or it can be integrated in the colonoscopy devices.",,,,,,,,,,,

It is through this online channel that we believe we can establish a link between your and our services.

Their KYnergy technology uses the textile Celliant to recycle the body's waste energy back for the benefit of the wearer, to enhance performance and accelerate recovery processes. They designed and engineered their specialist sportswear to work harder for you, so you can perform at your MAXIMUM potential.

KYMIRA Sport products have been designed specifically with the purpose of enhancing performance and accelerating recovery. With their inbuilt KYnergy infrared technology embedded within the fibres of their fabrics, your body gains from the following responses that occur when you are exposed to infrared. click on the PROVEN benefits below to find out exactly how the magic happens!

Using their KYnergy infrared technology causes an increase in a molecule called Nitric Oxide (NO) which is a vasodilator. This means that NO causes your blood vessels to expand, allowing more blood to pass through them 

Putting it simply, using their KYnergy infrared technology means that your muscles have more fuel available and work more efficiently. Breaking this down, because your circulation is increased, more oxygen is delivered to the muscle cells (more fuel).  


There isn't a simple way to explain this, but in short: when you use KYMIRA kit, the infrared causes NO to dissociate from the active site of one of the enzyme Cytochrome-C Oxidase which is part of the energy production process within your cells. Because the active site is free, the metabolic processes within your cells occur quicker resulting in a number of further responses: increased energy (ATP) production and cells grow, repair & replicate quicker.

Finally studies have found that using their technology will alleviate pain because as well as acting as a vasodilator, NO also reacts with a molecule called cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) which then mediates a pain relief response. The NO & cGMP reaction is actually the same way that taking an opiate like morphine works, but infrared is a lot less potent.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,Eximis Surgical,"Eximis Surgical is developing an enabling technology that allows surgeons to quickly and easily remove large specimens through small incisions while creating clean cut segments more adequate for pathology.  Because large surgical incisions lead to increases in patient pain, recovery time and complications, this transformational approach will substantially improve patient outcomes.  Eximis’ technology is not a morcellator but rather uses RF energized cutting wires temporarily held in place within a containment bag.  After fast loading and segmentation of the specimen, surgeons can easily and safely remove segments through the exteriorized bag opening.  Keeping surgical incisions small for millions of patients results in substantial healthcare cost savings due to reduced postoperative complications and hospital length of stay.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,Magnetic Insight,"Business Summary:
Magnetic Insight (MI) introduced magnetic particle imaging into the preclinical diagnostic research market ($800M TAM) enabling quantitative cell tracking, imaging of vascular function, detecting metastatic tumors, visualizing inflammation, CAR-T cell therapies and initial research into regenerative medicine.  Premier global research institutions are lining up to secure their place in line following the breakthroughs pioneered by researchers at Stanford with the initial commercial (and paid) installation. 

Problem:
The pre-clinical research and clinical markets have unmet needs in quantitative cell tracking, monitoring vascular function, and visualizing the immune system, among others.  Currently, optical imaging has the largest user base but serious limitations to clinical translation.  PET and SPECT imaging require radioisotopes and long-term studies are limited due to isotopes half-life.  Clinically, there is a severe need in neuroradiology as CT angiography protocols are being reduced due to excessively high radiation and toxicities associated with Iodine and MRI gadolinium.  Perfusion imaging suffers severe data clarity challenges with current technologies.

Solution:

When finished, notes go automatically to the provider's EMR, prescriptions go to patient's pharmacy of choice, and patients get an electronic AVS, and scheduled follow-up messaging to ensure that they are improving as expected.

SmartExam reduces the time spent on the low-acuity conditions, such as colds, flus and earaches by up to 90%.  Because these types of conditions can make up as much as half of Primary Care visit volumes, this approach can expand medical group capacity by 30%, reduce incremental visit costs by 80%, and grow total margin by up to 3x for provider groups.

That level of reduced visit costs make care dramatically more affordable for patients and payers, while still improving margins for providers, and increasing their efficiency by an order of magnitude. All this happens through a beautiful online tool, that delights providers and patients, without the patient ever having to come into their doctor’s office.",,,,,,,,,,,

health care,NociMed,"Nocimed is located in Redwood City, CA and was founded in 2008 by Jim Peacock (CEO), Dr. Jeff Lotz, Dr. David Bradford, and Emerge-Nocimed, LLC (medical device incubator) to commercially develop disruptive new pain imaging technologies co-invented by Drs. Lotz and Bradford at, and exclusively licensed from, UC San Francisco. The extensive experience and cross-functional backgrounds of these co-founders merge for the second time with Nocimed, which follows another disruptive new spine therapy company also previously co-founded and successfully launched under their combined leadership. This same consortium provides the foundation for Nocimed's on-going direction and execution, which has already successfully achieved many significant milestones. 

The company has conducted its operations since early 2008 on over $3.5 million dollars of Series A Preferred financing.  This was raised via private placement “Angel” investments via accredited investors, including from each of the company’s founders and a long list of world renowned thought leaders in spine surgery, pain management, and imaging/radiology.  The company's direction and management continue to be led by its co-founders, and via an expanded team of management and operational professionals - and other consultants - adding further significant experience and acumen in engineering, sales & marketing, reimbursement, and regulatory/quality/clinical affairs relevant to the company's field. 

The company already achieved many significant development milestones for its primary first investigational product, NociscanTM, involving multiple inventions captured in intellectual property owned by the Company. The company initially sponsored a $1MM/2 year co-development program at UCSF from early 2008 to early 2010.  This principally featured feasibility clinical studies to initially develop the technology for use with one initial commercially available high field MR system for robustly acquired and post-processed in vivo MRS data, and to train a diagnostic algorithm based on that MRS data which correlates highly to pain and degeneration per other standard diagnostic controls (e.g. including invasive discogram for pain).  The data from this initial investigational clinical development study demonstrated high procedural success for the Nociscan MRS diagnostic platform, with extremely high diagnostic accuracy against standard controls for diagnosing discs as painful vs. non-painful, and was the subject of multiple podium presentations in various medical and scientific society venues. 

Nocimed's more recent activities and objectives have been to advance Nociscan in next investigational development steps from the successful initial development and feasibility experience enjoyed at UC San Francisco.  This has principally involved development for cross-platform use via multiple different MR system platforms from different manufacturers, and while gathering more clinical data for assessing correlations and algorithm training.  The company plans to complete this development under an on-going multi-platform, multi-center study that was IRB approved in October 2011 and launched on a first platform (Siemens 3T Verio) in November 2011.  While Nociscan is being developed and evaluated for compatible use with various MR systems from multiple manufacturers, the company is using the current study and conducting concurrent negotiations to evaluate which MR system(s) will be chosen for advancement for future trials, regulatory pathways, and ultimate planned commercialization in the future.  Upon successful completion of this study, the company plans to freeze the platform design for a first generation planned product offering, and conduct a prospective, multi-center trial to further confirm the robustness of the uses intended for regulatory clearance of the platform.  These latter activities are likely to be conducted via a multi-$ million dollar Series B Preferred financing that the company plans to conduct by mid-2011.",,,,,,,,,,,
